Advanced Dependency Injection
=============================

## Microsoft ASP.NET Core Documentation
Microsoft ASP.NET Core makes heavy use of DI as explained in this repository.
They have a long article about DI as well including very basic usage of it,
as well as what services the framework registers and how to access them.

## GitHub Wiki note about intended implementation of DI frameworks
An archived GitHub on the aspnet organization on GitHub contains a writeup of notes
of how dependency injection frameworks are supposed to implement the abstractions
and also explains, how the default implementation handles dependency resolution.

This is a bit more technical, and assumes you know a little bit about the general solution.
It is however possible to understand most of it without any knowledge and some speculation.
